# RoomBookingRAM19
Room booking system designed for hackathon 2019



Inspiration

We were inspired by the existing study room booking system at our school which allows students to view empty rooms and book them from that view.
What it does

The program displays the available times of the specific meeting room in an interactive UI, and allows the users to book any room during those hours.
How I built it

We used Java as our main program, creating both the interactive front end that updates based on the booking as well as the storage for keeping track of who booked which meeting rooms during the certain times.
Challenges I ran into

Using 2D ArrayList, Graphic positioning, and pixel stuffs.
Accomplishments that I'm proud of

It was really fun to code.
What I learned

We learned how to implement graphics.
What's next for Room

Add the calendar year and update the design.
